The Five Stages
---------------

[[the-resting-place]]
*The Resting place*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Earth.

[[the-ability]]
*The Ability*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tough ones survive. Here are those who endure, who persist, who are the
warriors, who nibble steel. The question still remains, do they own this
strength. No they don't, they just owe it. Jis hath jor kar vekhe soi

[[the-realisation]]
*The Realisation*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realisation and knowledge lead to the knowledge of the fact that our
knowing power is limited. What can be realised is the Anand, the feeling
of bliss , the pleasure of knowing.

[[the-beauty]]
*The Beauty*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Humility carves the statue and beautifes it. Myrids of beauties are
carved. Most beautifully carved are those who have Rama enshrined in the
heart. Sita resides in the showering praises. They aren't engulfed by
Kaal, the Mind. Nor they are constantly robbed by the ve thieves.

[[the-truth]]
*The Truth*
~~~~~~~~~~~

Here only the truth remains. The Formless, beyond time. By the grace ,
they experience it.
