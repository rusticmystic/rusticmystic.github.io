**The Resting place**
-------------------------
The Earth.

**The Ability**
----------------------
Tough ones survive. Here are those who endure, who persist, who are the warriors,
who nibble steel. The question still remains, do they own this strength. No they
don't, they just owe it. Jis hath jor kar vekhe soi

**The Realisation**
----------------------

Realisation and knowledge lead to the knowledge of the fact that our knowing power
is limited. What can be realised is the Anand, the feeling of
bliss , the pleasure of knowing.

**The Beauty**
-----------------

Humility carves the statue and beautifes it. Myrids of beauties are carved. Most
beautifully carved are those who have Rama enshrined in the heart.
Sita resides in the showering praises. They aren't engulfed by Kaal, the Mind.
Nor they are constantly robbed by the ve thieves.

**The Truth**
----------------
Here only the truth remains. The Formless, beyond time. By the grace , they
experience it.
